# ConcurrentDeadlockDetection
Based on a research paper on concurrent deadlock detection in parallel programs by W.Haque(source is in the repo), built a proof of concept of the MPIDD model that was discussed in the paper, using C++ and MPI. 
Made a short presentation on each component and it's functionality in the MPIDD system.
